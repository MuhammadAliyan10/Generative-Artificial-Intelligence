# Linear Regression

_Linear regression is a method used to solve supervised ML problems. Supervised Machine Learning means we have both input and output data. We make an algorithm and train that algorithm according to that data. After that we give some new input data to that algorithm and it will give us result._

*There are two types of supervised machine learning.*
- _Regression_
- _Classification_

_If the output data is numerical like 200, 9.43 its known as `Regression` and if the data is category vise we say that as `Classification`._

## Explanation
_Linear Formula : `y = mx + b`_
- _`m` is the slope or Gradient_
- _`b` is the y intercept_

In simple words, when we draw a graph of given points we draw a line where the bias(error) is minimum. So we can draw the close to the perfect line by changing slope or the intercept.
_I say `close to the perfect` because in real word scenario the linear regression would never be perfect. ._
